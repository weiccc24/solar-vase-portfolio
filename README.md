# 🌸 Solar Vase Project Portfolio 🌸

A sunlight-following vase designed to help indoor plants receive balanced sunlight throughout the day.

## 🌻 Project Overview & Purpose

This repository hosts the official Final Project Website for the Solar Vase, developed by Mengting Li, Janice Zhou, and Wei Chang.

The primary function of this GitHub Page is to serve as an online record and self-explanatory portfolio of our project concept, design goals, and implementation, thereby satisfying the project requirements (FP1.1 - FP1.4). The content on this site is a professional, comprehensive showcase intended for employers, clients, and educators.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🪴 Problem & Solution

Seattle's cloudy, rainy climate leaves indoor plants with limited natural light. Our Solar Vase combines an intelligent rotating mechanism with the aesthetic language of traditional Eastern vases. It automatically tracks available sunlight, providing plants with balanced light exposure throughout the day, thus mitigating the risk of disease and improving long-term growth.

### ⚙️ Implementation

The core of the system is a precision-engineered base housing a Light Sensor, a Motor, and a Four-Gear Drive System. This mechanism allows for slow, silent, and accurate rotation, keeping the Light Sensor perpetually aligned with the strongest light source.

### 👥 Team Contributions

- **Wei Chang:** Management of the intelligent rotating mechanism, electronics prototyping, and component selection. 

## 💻 Repository Structure

This repository is structured for easy deployment via GitHub Pages, ensuring a clean, professional online portfolio:

| File/Directory | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| `index.html`   | The main, single-page website structure |
| `style.css`    | Custom styling to achieve a minimalist, Squarespace-like aesthetic |
| `images/`      | Contains all project photos, diagrams (`exploded_view_of_the_gear_mechanism.png`), and process photos (`3d_printing.png`, `design_process.png`) |
| `.gitignore`   | Ensures local system files (like `.DS_Store`) are excluded from the repository |

## 🔎 Documentation Highlights (Found on the Website)

- **Gallery:** High-quality photographs of the final product and close-up illustrations of the internal mechanical structure.  
- **Video:** An embedded demonstration video (FP1.4) showcasing the vase tracking light in real-time.  
- **Process:** Documentation of all design iterations, including sketches and 3D printing attempts, with brief descriptions of lessons learned at each stage.  
- **Future Improvements:** Plans for app development, wireless power, and assembly refinement.  
- **Links:** Optional external documentation links (e.g., Fusion 360 files).
