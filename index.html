                <div class="text-content">
                    <p class="lead-paragraph">Seattle's cloudy, rainy climate leaves indoor plants with limited natural light. Plant owners must manually reposition plants throughout the day, which is inconvenient and inefficient for healthy long-term growth; insufficient light also increases the risk of diseases and pests.</p>
                    <p>Our solution, the **Solar Vase**, successfully addresses this by integrating an intelligent rotating mechanism with the aesthetic language of traditional Eastern vases. The system automatically tracks the sun, ensuring the plant receives optimal, balanced light throughout the day.</p>

                    <p>Our iterative process allowed us to refine both the functional mechanics and the product's overall appearance, starting from simple aesthetic concepts to detailed 3D printed prototypes.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="process-iteration">
                    <h3>Iteration 1: Conceptualization and Modeling</h3>
                    <p>Initial focus was on identifying the ideal form, resulting in the exploration of different **bottom patterns** and **vase shapes**. We used digital modeling to simulate various aesthetic options. **Learned:** The double-gourd shape provided the best balance of traditional elegance and space required for internal components, leading us to refine the connection structure early on.</p>

                <div class="process-iteration">
                    <h3>Iteration 2: Prototyping and Mechanism Testing</h3>
                    <p>We moved into **3D printing** to create functional prototypes of the base, gear covers, and the four-gear system. This phase was critical for testing tolerances and fit. **Learned:** The fine structural details (like the vase fluting) required extremely high-resolution printing, and we had to slightly increase the size of the base joints to account for printing shrinkage and ensure smooth, silent mechanical operation.</p>

                    <p><strong>Reflections on the Process:</strong> The most delightful aspect was seeing the final prototype successfully track the light. The major challenge involved ensuring the robustness of the gear system at micro-scale while maintaining a discreet, aesthetic enclosure. We achieved this by simplifying the electronic requirements and focusing on high-precision printing.</p>
